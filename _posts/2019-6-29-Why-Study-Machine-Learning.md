title: Why I decided to study Machine Learning

I think the best place to start this blog is by discussing what lead me to decide to study Machine Learning to begin with...

For the past couple of years, I have been looking for something that checks all (or as many as possible) of my boxes for 'best career path'.

This list includes things like:
- Possibility of working remotely
- Technical, challenging, project-based work
- Pays well (for me personally this is >$75k and moving toward >$100k within a few years)
- Some team work, some solo work
- 'Future-proof' high/growing demand field
- Skills are transferable across industries
- Utilizes at least some of my current skillset (I don't want to start from scratch!)

The first item on that list, remote work, mostly limits me to jobs that only require a computer and internet connection... like Programming! 

### A short story of my past programming experience
In uni I took several classes that required (or were greatly aided by) using VBA and MATLAB. For the most part, I only used them as a means to an end, i.e. getting through my work as efficiently as possible. I also took part in a small undergraduate research group that basically played with simple simulations on the ORNL Kraken supercomuter by shelling in and passing commands over. ORNL was nice enough to give us a tour and ended up donating a decent chunk of computation time for our group to experiment with. We learned about parallel computations using various parallelizing techniques such as Open-MP and MPI. I found it fascinating but as an intro course it was a mile-wide inch-deep coverage of topics and I never went far with it. That pretty much sums up my brush with programming during my undergrad studies. I enjoyed using it when needed but there's not a lot of focus on programming in ..._to be continued_
