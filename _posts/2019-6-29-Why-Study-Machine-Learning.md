title: Why I decided to study Machine Learning

I think the best place to start this blog is by discussing what lead me to decide to study Machine Learning to begin with.

For the past couple of years, I have been looking for something that checks all (or as many as possible) of my boxes for 'best career path'.

This list includes things like:
[ ] Possibility of working remotely
- [ ] Challenging, project-based work
- [ ] Pays well (for me this is >$75k with potential for >$100k)
- [ ] Mix of collaborative and solo work responsibilities
- [ ] 'Future-proof' growing/high-demand field
- [ ] Skills are transferable across industries
- [ ] Utilizes at least some of my current skillset (I don't want to start from scratch!)

The first item, remote work, mostly limits me to jobs that only require a computer and internet connection... like Programming! So this lead me to considering what possibilities there were in the programming world that I would enjoy and could check the most boxes. 

### My past experience with programming
In uni I took several classes that required (or were greatly aided by) using VBA and MATLAB. For the most part, I only used them as a means to an end, i.e. getting through my work as efficiently as possible. They were great tools for completing assignments with ease once I had a basic understanding but I did not appreciate their full potential. I was also one of six asked to start a small undergraduate research group that played with simple simulations on the ORNL Kraken supercomuter by shelling in and passing commands over. ORNL was nice enough to give us a tour and donate a decent chunk of computation time for our group to experiment with. We learned about parallel computations using various parallelizing techniques such as Open-MP and MPI. I found it fascinating, but as an intro course it was a mile-wide inch-deep coverage of topics and my primary focus was to graduate and find a design job at the time. That pretty much sums up my brush with programming during my undergrad studies. I enjoyed coding when it helped and found it intuitive to learn but there's not a lot of focus on programming in a BSME program.
