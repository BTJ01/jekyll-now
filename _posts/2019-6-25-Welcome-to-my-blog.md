title: Welcome to my new blog!

This is a whole new world for me! Not just creating a blog, but using GitHub, coding in Python, studying Machine Learning... It's all brand new to me and there's SO MUCH TO LEARN! I intend to regularly write short blogs discussing what I'm working on and how it's going.

I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with the amount of stuff; the services, apps, libraries, add-ons, plug-ins, features, new lingo, blah blah blah.  I'm thankful I can at least manage projects and this blog in one convenient place. I imagine in a few months this will all be a little more comfortable and familiar. It will be fun to look back and see what progress I've made. 

I want to thank #barryclark for creating Jekyll-Now which has allowed me to set up a basic static blogging site with minimal struggles. I'm loving how supportive the programming community feels so far! There's seemingly limitless resources to learn and grow and I'll be tapping into as many as I need in order to accomplish my goals. 

Speaking of which, my current goals for this new journey:
  1. Spend the next year reading every book about DS that I can get my hands on
  2. Take as many online Machine Learning courses as I can afford the time/money for
  3. Go to meetups, conferences, workshops, or whatever else is out there that could help me learn, grow, and network
  4. Work on solo projects and possibly group projects to build my skillset and practice what I learn
  5. Become an active member of the GitHub community, try contributing where I can
  

That's all I've got for now. It's late, I have a normal 8-5 job in the morning, and I've been sitting at a computer for hours. I need to go stretch and play with my dog. âœŒ
