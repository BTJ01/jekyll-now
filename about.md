### What's this blog about?

This is a personal blog I've created to detail my journey studying Machine Learning and what comes of it. I intend to use this space to discuss what I'm working on, share stories and projects, and more or less be a public diary of anything related to Machine Learning from my perspective. There will likely be struggles, rants, and other developments in this blog... hope you enjoy the ride!

### Why did you make it?

I think that at the very least it's a fun, new project that helps me learn and grow. I've never blogged before and frankly I'm uncomfortable doing it but look at me go anyway! Take that self-conscious fear of rejection and failure! 


### What purpose does it serve?

I hope this blog will become encouragement or possibly a guide to someone in a similar place trying to decide what to do with their life. Also, I need a place to showcase my growth, understanding, and achievements as I study and practice using ML! Who knows, maybe someday someone will be reading this trying to decide if I've got the chops for a sweet Data Scientist gig that I applied for, and seeing my blog will help make their decision easier (in my favor I hope! ðŸ¤ž)
